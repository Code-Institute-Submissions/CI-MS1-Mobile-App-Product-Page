# Mobile App Product Page

First Code Institute Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development
This Website is dedicated to an iOS Calendar App which I'm currently developing. The page promotes the App and its features, provides a user manual and contact information.

***
## UX
### User Stories:
- Customer: I want to know what the app can do, and what the difference is from existing products
- App Store: A product website is required by Apple in order to submit an App in the App Store.

### Strategy
Effectively communicate the goal of a specific Calendar App to potential customers, and provide more in-depth information for customers who downloaded the App already.

### Scope
Explain why this App is easier and faster to use than other calendar Apps, present the key features of the app, provide an online and downloadable user manual, Provide a contact form for feedback and updates, and show an App Store download link. 

### Structure
Use of a common tree structure type: Navigation bar and 4 sections which are all accessible from anywhere on the page, answering the following questions:
- Home (Why?)
- Key Features (What?)
- Manual  (How?)
- Contact form and personal information (Who?)
- App Store download link (Where?)

### Skeleton
[Wireframes](/Wireframes.pdf)

### Surface
The App is meant to make it easier to use a Calendar on the iPhone. Therefore, the design is also very simple and clear, with minimum color and animation, which directs the viewer's focus on product images and the actual text. The color theme follows the following pattern:
- theme: dark
- Normal text and titles: blue
- Links: white
- emphazised: orange
the colors orange, white and dark grey follow the color theme of the App program-icon
