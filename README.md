# Mobile App Product Page

First Code Institute Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development
This Website is dedicated to an iOS Calendar App which I'm currently developing. The page promotes the App and its features, provides a user manual and contact information.

## UX
### User Stories:
- Customer: I want to know what the app can do, and what the difference is from existing products
- App Store: A product website is required by Apple in order to submit an App in the App Store.

### Strategy
Effectively communicate the goal of a specific Calendar App to potential customers, and provide more in-depth information for customers who downloaded the App already.

### Scope
Explain why this App is easier and faster to use than other calendar Apps, present the key features of the app, provide an online and downloadable user manual, Provide a contact form for feedback and updates, and show an App Store download link. 

### Structure
Use of a common tree structure type: Navigation bar and 4 sections which are all accessible from anywhere on the page, answering the following questions: - Home (Why?) - Key Features (What?) - Manual  (How?) - Contact form and personal information (Who?) - App Store download link (Where?)

### Skeleton
--- Wireframe (not done yet)

### Surface
The App is meant to make it easier to use a Calendar on the iPhone. Therefore, the design is also very simple and clear, with minimum of color, which directs the viewer's focus on product images and the actual text.
